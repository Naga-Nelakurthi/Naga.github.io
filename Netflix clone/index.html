                            Watch Netflix on your smartphone, tablet, smart TV, laptop or streaming device, all for
                            one fixed monthly fee. Plans range from £4.99 to £15.99 a month. No extra costs, no

                            An advert-supported plan is a great way to enjoy films and TV programmes at a lower
                            price. You can stream your favourites with limited advert breaks (some location and
                            device restrictions apply). Downloads are not supported and a limited number of films
                            and TV programmes are not available due to licensing restrictions. Learn more.

                            The Netflix Children's experience is included in your membership to give parents control
                            while children enjoy family-friendly TV programmes and films in their own space.

                            Children's profiles come with PIN-protected parental controls that let you restrict the
                            maturity rating of content children can watch and block specific titles you don’t want
                            children to see.
